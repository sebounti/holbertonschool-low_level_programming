Low Level Programming & Algorithms

Welcome

Thank you for visiting my programming projects. The majority of the code was written in C, with a few files written in Assembly.

About

This repository contains projects on the C programming language. The projects cover:

    Compilation
    Commenting code and following a coding style standard
    Variables, types, operators, expressions, loops, nested loops
    Conditional statements
    Functions
    Pre-processor, macros, header files, pointers, double pointers, function pointers, pointer arithmetic
    Arrays, multidimensional arrays, structures
    Static and dynamic libraries
    Program arguments
    Dynamic allocation
    Virtual memory, heap, stack
    Binary operations
    Makefiles
    Sorting and search algorithms and more!

Requirements

    Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    gcc 4.8.4 (-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic flags)

ow-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

    0x00. C - Hello, World
    0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
    0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
    0x03. C - Debugging
    0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
    0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
    0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
    0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
    0x08. C - Recursion
    0x09. C - Static libraries
    0x0A. C - argc, argv
    0x0B. C - malloc, free
    0x0C. C - More malloc, free
    0x0D. C - Preprocessor
